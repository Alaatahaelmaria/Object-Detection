# Object-Detection
Object Detection is the path toward finding genuine objects like vehicles, bikes, TV, and people in still pictures or Videos. It thinks about the affirmation, limitation, and ID of different things inside an image which outfits us with a significantly improved cognizance of an image all things considered. It is conventionally used in applications, for instance, picture recuperation, security, surveillance, and so forth.
